## ✅ FILE PURPOSE

`App.js` is the **main component** in your React app. It handles:

* State (data) for all expenses.
* Search and filter logic.
* Editing, deleting, and adding expenses.
* Passing this data/logic to child components.

---

## ✅ 1. **Imports**

```js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';
import ExpenseForm from './components/ExpenseForm';
import ExpenseList from './components/ExpenseList';
import './App.css';
```

* `useState` → for managing state like expenses, search input, etc.
* `useEffect` → for loading/saving to `localStorage`.
* `uuidv4()` → generates a unique ID when adding new expenses.
* `ExpenseForm` → form for adding/editing expense items.
* `ExpenseList` → displays the list of expenses.
* `App.css` → styling.

---

## ✅ 2. **State Declarations**

```js
const [expenses, setExpenses] = useState([]);
const [editingExpense, setEditingExpense] = useState(null);
const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
const [selectedCategory, setSelectedCategory] = useState('All');
```

* `expenses`: array of all expense objects.
* `editingExpense`: stores the current item being edited, or `null`.
* `searchTerm`: stores the string from the search input.
* `selectedCategory`: stores the category selected from the dropdown.

---

## ✅ 3. **Load Expenses from Local Storage on Page Load**

```js
useEffect(() => {
  const stored = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('expenses')) || [];
  setExpenses(stored);
}, []);
```

* This `useEffect` runs only once on first load.
* It tries to get saved data from `localStorage` and sets it in the state.

---

## ✅ 4. **Save Expenses to Local Storage Whenever They Change**

```js
useEffect(() => {
  localStorage.setItem('expenses', JSON.stringify(expenses));
}, [expenses]);
```

* Runs whenever `expenses` changes.
* Updates localStorage so you don't lose data on refresh.

---

## ✅ 5. **Add or Update Expense**

```js
const handleAddExpense = (expense) => {
  if (editingExpense) {
    const updated = expenses.map((exp) =>
      exp.id === expense.id ? expense : exp
    );
    setExpenses(updated);
    setEditingExpense(null);
  } else {
    setExpenses([...expenses, { ...expense, id: uuidv4() }]);
  }
};
```

* If we're editing → find the matching item by `id` and replace it.
* If adding → append a new item with a unique `id`.

---

## ✅ 6. **Edit an Expense**

```js
const handleEditExpense = (id) => {
  const toEdit = expenses.find((exp) => exp.id === id);
  setEditingExpense(toEdit);
};
```

* Finds the expense by its `id` and sets it in `editingExpense` for pre-filling the form.

---

## ✅ 7. **Delete an Expense**

```js
const handleDeleteExpense = (id) => {
  setExpenses(expenses.filter((exp) => exp.id !== id));
};
```

* Removes the expense that matches the given `id`.

1. handleDeleteExpense = (id) => { ... }
This function is called when you click "Delete" on an expense.
It receives the id of the item you want to delete.

2. expenses.filter(...)
filter() is a JavaScript array method that returns a new array containing only items that pass a condition.
In this case, we want to keep only the expenses whose id is NOT equal to the id of the item to delete.

3. (exp) => exp.id !== id
exp represents each individual expense in the array.
exp.id !== id means:
If this condition is true (i.e. the expense is not the one to delete), it will be kept in the new array.
If false (i.e. exp.id === id), it will be excluded.

4. setExpenses(...)
After filtering, we update the state expenses with the new array (that has the item removed).
React will then re-render the list without that deleted item.

---

## ✅ 8. **Filter + Search Logic**

```js
const filteredExpenses = expenses.filter((expense) => {
  const matchesSearch = expense.title.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase());
  const matchesCategory = selectedCategory === 'All' || expense.category === selectedCategory;
  return matchesSearch && matchesCategory;
});
```

* This logic filters the `expenses` array based on:
  * Matching search input in `title`
  * Matching category from dropdown


Absolutely! Let's **break this code down line-by-line** so you fully understand what it's doing and how it's filtering your expenses based on **search input** and **selected category**.

---

### ✅ Code:

```js
const filteredExpenses = expenses.filter((expense) => {
  const matchesSearch = expense.title.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase());
  const matchesCategory = selectedCategory === 'All' || expense.category === selectedCategory;
  return matchesSearch && matchesCategory;
});
```

---

### ✅ Goal:

Create a **new array of expenses** that match both:

1. What the user has typed in the **search box**.
2. What category is selected in the **dropdown** (like Food, Rent, etc.).

---

### 🔍 Step-by-Step Breakdown:

#### 🟡 `expenses.filter((expense) => { ... })`

* `.filter()` is used to **go through every item** in the `expenses` array.
* It **keeps only those** for which the `return` condition is true.
* `expense` is a single object from the array during each loop (like `{ title: 'Pizza', category: 'Food', ... }`).

#### 🟢 Line 1:

```js
const matchesSearch = expense.title.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase());
```
* This checks whether the **expense title matches the search input**.
* `toLowerCase()` is used so the comparison is **case-insensitive**.
* `includes()` returns true if the search term is found **anywhere** in the title.

🧠 Example:

```js
expense.title = "Groceries";
searchTerm = "gro";
=> "groceries".includes("gro") → true
```
#### 🔵 Line 2:
```js
const matchesCategory = selectedCategory === 'All' || expense.category === selectedCategory;
```
* This checks whether the item matches the selected category.
* If `All` is selected, we **allow all items**.
* Otherwise, it only allows items with the **same category**.

🧠 Example:

```js
selectedCategory = "Food"
expense.category = "Rent" → false
expense.category = "Food" → true
```

---

#### 🟣 Line 3:

```js
return matchesSearch && matchesCategory;
```

* Both conditions must be true to keep the item:
  * It should match the **search input**, and
  * It should match the **selected category** (or be included in All).

---

### ✅ Final Output:

The result is a **new array** (`filteredExpenses`) that contains only the items:

* Whose **title includes** what the user typed, and
* That match the **selected category** (or all if "All" is selected)

---

### 💡 Example Scenario:
Suppose:
```js
expenses = [
  { title: "Pizza", category: "Food" },
  { title: "Rent", category: "Rent" },
  { title: "Burger", category: "Food" }
];

searchTerm = "p";
selectedCategory = "Food";
```
Filtered output:
✅ `"Pizza"` → matches `"p"` and `"Food"` → **Included**
❌ `"Rent"` → doesn't match category → **Excluded**
❌ `"Burger"` → doesn't match search `"p"` → **Excluded**
Only `Pizza` is returned.

---

## ✅ 9. **UI Rendering (JSX)**

```jsx
<div className="App">
  <h1>Expense Tracker</h1>

  {/* Search and Category Filter Section */}
  <div className="filter-section">
    <input
      type="text"
      placeholder="Search by title..."
      value={searchTerm}
      onChange={(e) => setSearchTerm(e.target.value)}
    />
    <select value={selectedCategory} onChange={(e) => setSelectedCategory(e.target.value)}>
      <option value="All">All</option>
      <option value="Food">Food</option>
      <option value="Rent">Rent</option>
      <option value="Utilities">Utilities</option>
      <option value="Entertainment">Entertainment</option>
    </select>
  </div>

  {/* Form Component */}
  <ExpenseForm onSave={handleAddExpense} editingExpense={editingExpense} />

  {/* List Component */}
  <ExpenseList
    expenses={filteredExpenses}
    onEdit={handleEditExpense}
    onDelete={handleDeleteExpense}
  />
</div>
```

* Displays the page title.
* Renders:

  * Search input
  * Category dropdown
  * Expense form (with `onSave` handler)
  * Expense list (with filtered data and handlers for edit/delete)

---

## ✅ Summary of How the App Works

1. You load the app → data is loaded from `localStorage`.
2. You enter new expense → `handleAddExpense()` adds it with unique ID.
3. You edit → form is pre-filled and update logic replaces it.
4. You delete → item is removed.
5. You search/filter → `filteredExpenses` dynamically updates what is shown.
6. All changes are saved in `localStorage`.
